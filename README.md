 Complete Database | CIS-202 Final Project | SC4
 
 This project was a compilation of many different elements that we learned throughout the Databases class at St. Clair County Community College. This database was created using Microsoft Access and was made as a way to simply input data into a database while also being able to access that data by other means. Overall, this project was great at establishing my foundation of databases, and also put my foot into the door of SQL. Documentation within the project was made more informal than other projects as we had to make a "quick start guide" that could be used by employees, although it does contain similar elements.
